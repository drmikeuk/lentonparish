            <p>One of the ways we express our gratitude to God for all he has given to us is by being generous in our own giving. Giving is an act of worship. We recognise that this happens in many different ways. The church could not exist without people giving their time, skills, energies and money.</p>

            <p>The majority of our income comes from the generous gifts and regular donations of our congregations and other individuals who support the church.</p>

            <p>Your generous giving makes everything we do in Lenton possible, including Sunday services, midweek groups, enabling mission and outreach in the parish, paying staff salaries, our contribution to the work of the diocese (which in turn pays our clergy) and maintaining our historic buildings.</p>

            <p>If you would like to give to Holy Trinity and the Priory churches financially there are different ways of doing this...</p>
