            <p>Dry rot was first discovered in 2013, investigations showed that the damage was extensive and the building was closed in August 2014.</p>

            <p>The entire roof was stripped, roof timbers affected by dry rot repaired, and slates replaced and re-laid. Gutters were reformed to improve drainage of rainwater and reduce risk of further dry rot in the future.</p>

            <p>After a huge project of work, that we hope will secure the building for the next 100 years, the building reopened on 11th June 2016.</p>

            <p>The old boiler failed so we have replaced it and upgraded the heating to make it effective and energy efficient.  The tower roof has also been repaired and re-leaded.</p>
