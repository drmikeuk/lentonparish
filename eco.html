            <h3>Worship and teaching</h3>
            <p>We pray for sustainability in God's creation and the inhabitants that dwell in it on a weekly basis. We try and integrate environmental considerations into our liturgy, sermons and worship songs however this is something that we could do more often</p>

            <h3>Buildings</h3>
            <p>We use LED lighting where possible and aim to use LED lighting across all our buildings.
              We never use single use items such as disposable cups or spoons which helps minimise the waste we create.
              All of the energy we purchase and consume as a church comes from 100% renewable sources.</p>

            <h3>Land use</h3>
            <p>We are blessed with plentiful land in church grounds and wish to maximise it's use for the benefit of the environment and local community. We will do this through creating wildflower meadows with species native to Britain.
              We plan on undertaking wildlife surveys to help us understand what biodiversity exists within the land we care for, which can then lead to projects to help this biodiversity thrive</p>

            <h3>Community and local engagement</h3>
            <p>We are passionate about our local community and would love to see our congregation and community use the land we own for recreational purposes. We are currently considering changing what drinks and food we provide to reflect ethical choices.
              We could also collaborate with our community to plan litter picks, engage with the council and wildlife organisations.</p>

            <h3>Lifestyle</h3>
            <p>As a church we have recognised the importance for improving our sustainability, Rachel Potts who also sits on the church PCC is heading up this initiative and encouraging congregational participation.
              We encourage minimal car use and try to arrange car shares where we can for events.
              We intend to try and promote ethical and environmentally sustainable practices to our congregation, and work out what more we can do individually and as a church.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="well pale">
            <p>There is much we can be proud of as a church but we are humbled in knowing that there are many things we can still work on to be more environmentally sustainable.</p>

            <p>If you wish to make personal steps to improve your sustainability then there are likely to be many options for you. Below are a few ideas to get you started.</p>
            <ul class="fa-ul">
              <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-leaf"></i>Take a <a href="https://footprint.wwf.org.uk/">carbon footprint audit</a> to identify good current practices and areas to change.</li>
              <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-leaf"></i>For centuries Christians have fasted from meat twice a week. Could you join in their footsteps and consider reducing or eliminating your meat intake?</li>
              <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-leaf"></i>Consider what purchases you make and identify if you can reduce the plastic packaging you use.</li>
              <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-leaf"></i>Get into good recycling habits and check local recycling policies; Nottingham city council do not currently collect tetra packs for recycling but some shopping centres have collection banks.</li>
              <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-leaf"></i>Reduce your car use - consider lift shares, public transport or cycling.</li>
