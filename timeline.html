            <p>Designed by the architect Henry Isaac Stevens, the architectural style is Early English. With a high pitched roof there is a chancel, nave with clerestory, aisles to north and south, vestry and a large west end pinnacled tower with a clock and bell.</p>
            <p>The interior of the church has changed considerably since it was built, as there have been restorations and additions at various times.</p>
