<h4>We’ve restarted Sunday morning services in Holy Trinity!</h4>
<p>We will be having a joint Sunday service at 11am in Holy Trinity plus we will still livestream via <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HolyTrinityLenton">Facebook</a> for those who aren’t able to be with us in person.</p>

<p>Everyone will need to wear masks, wash and sanitize hands on arrival, and sit with appropriate space between households.</p>

<p>We are allowed to have musicians leading sung worship, but the congregation is not allowed to sing at the moment. Also we can’t offer any refreshments.</p>

<p>Feedback from people who have joined the Wednesday evening communion services has been that it has felt a little strange the first time they have come, but they’ve soon got used to the current way we have to do things and are pleased to be able to worship together in person again.<br/>
<b>So, please come and join us!</b></p>



          <p>We will be live streaming at 11am each Sunday via <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HolyTrinityLenton">Facebook</a></p>

          <p>If you miss it, don’t worry you can catch up on <a  href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChXe8gAf73BVDmMLHk-UKjA">YouTube...</a></p>
